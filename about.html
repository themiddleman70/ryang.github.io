<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Although I was born in Iowa in 1995, I've since found my way to Texas, though it wasn't my first stop after leaving Iowa.  I've lived in Georgia and Utah, and Texas, where I graduated from Friendswood High School in 2014.  Later,
I earned an Associate of Science in Computer Science from San Jacinto College in December 2016, followed by a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics and a Minor in Computer Science from Texas State University in August 2019.</p>

<p>After completing my bachelor's degree, I set my sights on returning to Utah, a place that feels like home to me because of its breathtaking scenery and the lasting friendships I've made there.  In November 2020, my dream came
true when I received a job offer from SelectHealth in Salt Lake City.  I lived and worked there for the next couple of years.  Unfortunately, personal issues arose in July 2023, leading me to return to Texas to live with my parents.</p>

<p>While living with my parents, I did my best to work on my personal issues that I was dealing at the time, and while doing so, I started looking for a new career, to which I did in May 2024.  As of today, I am still in my 
position at Integral Care.</p>

<h3>Fun Stuff</h3>

<p>Baseball has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember, thanks to my dad introducing me to the sport back in 2005.  Over the years, I've immersed myself in everything baseball, with a special dedication to my team,
the St. Louis Cardinals.  While I played baseball during my time in Iowa, I was still learning the ins and outs of the game and didn't quite reach superstar status on the field.</p>

<p>Gaming has been a constant in my life, starting from my days with the PlayStation 1 as a kid.  I've remained loyal to PlayStation, owning every major console from the PlayStation 1 to the PlayStation 4.  Although I've transitioned
to PC gaming in recent years, I still cherish my PlayStation roots.  MLB The Show and Need for Speed are among my favorite console games, while on PC, I indulge in simulation games like American Truck Simulator and Microsoft Flight
Simulator 2020.  I've also dived into GTA roleplay through FiveM, taking on various roles in the community.</p>

<p>Photography is another passion of mine, although I've taken a bit of a hiatus recently.  I'm eager to get back into it, especially capturing the beauty of nature with my camera.  My interest in photography blossomed during a
digital photography course in high school, and since then, I've been exploring different landscapes to capture stunning shots of trees, mountains, lakes, and more.</p>
